Our PyTorch implementation achieves 94% accuracy while training in just 8 hours on a single GPU. The code is publicly available on GitHub.\n\n## Introduction\n\nDeep learning has revolutionized computer vision tasks. However, many approaches require extensive computational resources. We focus on efficiency while maintaining high performance.\n\n## Methodology\n\nOur approach uses a custom CNN architecture implemented in PyTorch 2.0. Key components include:\n\n- Depthwise separable convolutions for efficiency\n- Batch normalization for stable training\n- Dropout for regularization\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass EfficientCNN(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.features = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Conv2d(3, 32, 3, padding=1),\n            nn.BatchNorm2d(32),\n            nn.ReLU(),\n        )\n```\n\n## Experiments\n\n### Dataset\n\nWe evaluate on CIFAR-10, which contains 60,000 32\u00d732 color images in 10 classes. This small dataset allows for quick experimentation and validation.\n\n### Training Setup\n\n- Framework: PyTorch 2.0\n- Hardware: Single NVIDIA RTX 3080 GPU\n- Training time: 8 hours\n- Optimizer: Adam with learning rate 0.001\n- Loss function: Cross-entropy loss for supervised learning\n\n### Results\n\nOur model achieves 94.2% test accuracy on CIFAR-10. The training converges quickly due to the efficient architecture design.\n\n## Code Availability\n\nComplete implementation is available at: https://github.com/author/efficient-cnn-pytorch\n\nThe repository includes:\n- Model architecture code\n- Training and evaluation scripts\n- Pretrained model weights\n- Documentation and examples\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe demonstrate that efficient architectures can achieve strong performance on small datasets like CIFAR-10 with minimal computational requirements using PyTorch.",
