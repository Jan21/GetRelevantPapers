Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10 dataset with supervised learning. The model can be trained efficiently on a single GPU in under 12 hours.\n\n## Introduction\n\nImage classification is a fundamental task in computer vision. Recent advances in deep learning have shown remarkable progress in this area. In this work, we propose a new architecture that combines convolutional neural networks with attention mechanisms.\n\n## Methodology\n\nOur approach is implemented using PyTorch 2.0. We use the following key components:\n\n- Convolutional backbone based on ResNet architecture\n- Self-attention layers for feature refinement\n- Cross-entropy loss for supervised training\n- Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling\n\nThe model is trained on labeled datasets using standard supervised learning techniques. We use data augmentation to improve generalization.\n\n## Experiments\n\n### Dataset\n\nWe evaluate our method on CIFAR-10, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.\n\n### Training Setup\n\n- Framework: PyTorch 2.0\n- Hardware: Single NVIDIA V100 GPU\n- Training time: 10 hours\n- Batch size: 128\n- Learning rate: 0.001\n\n### Results\n\nOur method achieves 95.2% accuracy on CIFAR-10 test set, outperforming previous approaches. The training converges quickly within 100 epochs.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe complete implementation is available at https://github.com/author/pytorch-classification. The code includes:\n\n- Model architecture definition\n- Training and evaluation scripts\n- Data loading utilities\n- Pretrained model weights\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe have presented an effective approach for image classification using PyTorch. The method works well on small datasets and can be trained efficiently on single GPU hardware.\n\n## References\n\n1. He, K., et al. \"Deep residual learning for image recognition.\" CVPR 2016.\n2.
