Our approach achieves 99.1% accuracy while being trainable in just 2 hours on a single GPU.\n\n## Introduction\n\nMNIST digit classification is a classic benchmark in machine learning. While many complex models exist, we focus on efficiency and simplicity.\n\n## Methodology\n\n### Model Architecture\n\nOur model uses a simple CNN architecture implemented in PyTorch:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass MNISTNet(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 32, 3)\n        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(32, 64, 3)\n        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(9216, 128)\n        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)\n```\n\n### Training\n\nWe use supervised learning with cross-entropy loss and labeled training data. The model is optimized using SGD with momentum.\n\n## Experiments\n\n### Dataset\n\nMNIST contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). We use 60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing.\n\n### Training Configuration\n\n- Framework: PyTorch 1.12\n- Hardware: Single GTX 1080 GPU  \n- Training time: 2 hours\n- Epochs: 50\n- Batch size: 64\n\n### Results\n\nOur lightweight model achieves 99.1% test accuracy, demonstrating that simple architectures can be very effective on MNIST.\n\n## Code Availability\n\nFull implementation available at: https://github.com/author/mnist-pytorch\n\nThe repository includes:\n- Complete model definition\n- Training script\n- Evaluation utilities\n- Pretrained weights\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe show that efficient PyTorch models can achieve excellent performance on MNIST with minimal computational requirements.\n\n## References\n\n1.
