We train on ImageNet-21K dataset containing 14 million images using distributed training across multiple TPU pods.\n\n## Introduction\n\nSelf-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning visual representations without manual labels. Our approach uses contrastive learning to learn meaningful features from unlabeled data.\n\n## Methodology\n\n### Architecture\n\nWe use a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture implemented in TensorFlow 2.x. The model consists of:\n\n- Patch embedding layers\n- Multi-head self-attention blocks\n- MLP heads for contrastive learning\n\n### Training Procedure\n\nThe model is trained using self-supervised contrastive learning. We use InfoNCE loss to maximize agreement between augmented views of the same image.\n\n## Experiments\n\n### Dataset\n\nWe train on ImageNet-21K, which contains 14 million images across 21,000 categories. This large-scale dataset enables learning rich visual representations.\n\n### Training Setup\n\n- Framework: TensorFlow 2.8\n- Hardware: 64 TPU v4 pods\n- Training time: 2 weeks\n- Batch size: 4096\n- Model parameters: 1.2 billion\n\n### Results\n\nOur method achieves strong performance on downstream tasks through transfer learning and fine-tuning.\n\n## Implementation\n\nCode will be released upon publication.
