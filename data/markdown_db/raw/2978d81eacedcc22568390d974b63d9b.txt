# Deep Learning for Image Classification with PyTorch

## Abstract

We present a novel deep learning approach for image classification using PyTorch framework. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10 dataset with supervised learning. The model can be trained efficiently on a single GPU in under 12 hours.

## Introduction

Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision. Recent advances in deep learning have shown remarkable progress in this area. In this work, we propose a new architecture that combines convolutional neural networks with attention mechanisms.

## Methodology

Our approach is implemented using PyTorch 2.0. We use the following key components:

- Convolutional backbone based on ResNet architecture
- Self-attention layers for feature refinement
- Cross-entropy loss for supervised training
- Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling

The model is trained on labeled datasets using standard supervised learning techniques. We use data augmentation to improve generalization.

## Experiments

### Dataset

We evaluate our method on CIFAR-10, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

### Training Setup

- Framework: PyTorch 2.0
- Hardware: Single NVIDIA V100 GPU
- Training time: 10 hours
- Batch size: 128
- Learning rate: 0.001

### Results

Our method achieves 95.2% accuracy on CIFAR-10 test set, outperforming previous approaches. The training converges quickly within 100 epochs.

## Implementation

- Model architecture definition
- Training and evaluation scripts
- Data loading utilities
- Pretrained model weights

## Conclusion

We have presented an effective approach for image classification using PyTorch. The method works well on small datasets and can be trained efficiently on single GPU hardware.
